- 👋 Hi, I’m Stefan Dörig
- 👀 I’m interested in programming - have worked as developer for 20 years.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust - I find it fun.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a bird house position finder. It should  
     - be a progressive web app
     - being usable on a smartphone
     - identify the bird house according to its QR code
     - taking pictures of the bird house
     - submitting its geo location
     - allow the user to submit the type of bird nest found in the house
     - show the history of the bird house
     - have a backend storing all this information
- 📫 How to reach me: github
